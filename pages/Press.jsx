"Our new app is designed to overcome these barriers and ensure that every farmer can benefit from our platform, regardless of their location or technical skills."</p>

        <p>Key features of the new app include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offline access to crop recommendations and farming guides</li>
          <li>Voice-based interface in 10 Indian languages</li>
          <li>Low-bandwidth mode for areas with poor connectivity</li>
          <li>Integration with local weather services for accurate forecasts</li>
          <li>Direct connection to agricultural experts for consultation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The app is being rolled out in phases across different states, starting with Maharashtra, Punjab, and Karnataka, with plans to cover all of India by the end of the year.</p>

        <p>KrishiAi has announced a strategic partnership with the Government of Maharashtra to promote sustainable farming practices and support small-scale farmers across the state.</p>

        <p>The partnership, which is part of the state's Agricultural Modernization Program, will provide 50,000 farmers with access to KrishiAi\'s technology platform at subsidized rates. The initiative aims to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impact, and improve farmers' incomes through the adoption of data-driven farming techniques.</p>

        <p>"This partnership represents a significant step forward in our efforts to modernize agriculture in Maharashtra," said the State Minister for Agriculture. "By combining the government's reach with KrishiAi\'s technology, we can help farmers make more informed decisions and adopt sustainable practices that benefit both their livelihoods and the environment."</p>

        <p>As part of the program, KrishiAi will conduct training workshops in rural communities to help farmers understand and utilize the platform effectively. The company will also work with local agricultural universities to develop region-specific crop recommendations and best practices.</p>

        <p>"We're honored to partner with the Government of Maharashtra on this important initiative," said Amit Patel, COO of KrishiAi. "This collaboration will allow us to reach farmers who might otherwise not have access to advanced agricultural technology, and help them improve their yields and incomes while practicing sustainable farming."</p>

        <p>The program will initially focus on six districts in Maharashtra, with plans to expand to the entire state within two years.</p>
